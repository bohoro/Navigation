# Navigation 
## A Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Navigation using the Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit.

### Project Report

In this project, I will demonstrate a Deep Q Learning approach to train an agent to solve the provided Banana navigation environment.  This report will elborate on the learning algorithm used, a plot of the scores (rewards) during training, as well as ideas for future work.  

If you would like to install and run the code see the installation steps [here](README.md).

## Learning Algorithm

##### to do

```
Training Agent
Episode 100	Average Score: 0.244
Episode 200	Average Score: 1.92
Episode 300	Average Score: 5.98
Episode 400	Average Score: 9.50
Episode 500	Average Score: 12.33
Episode 596	Average Score: 14.03
Environment solved in 496 episodes!	Average Score: 14.03
```

## Plot of Rewards

Please find below the plot of the training episodes.  The top plot is the 100 episode movign average while the bottom plot is the raw scores by episode.
