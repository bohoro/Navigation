# Navigation 
## A Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Navigation using the Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit.

In this project I will demonstrate a Deep Q Learning appraoch to train an agent to solve the provided Banana navigation environment.


#### Watch the trained agent in action.

### This project contains:
* Functional, well-documented, and organized code for training the agent implemented in PyTorch and Python 3
* Saved model weights for my successful agent

### A Note on Unity

The **Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents)** is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods through a simple-to-use Python API.

## Project Details

- ToDo - describs the the project environment details

## Getting Started

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
2. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bohoro/Navigation.git
cd Navigation/python
pip install .
```
