## A Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Navigation using the Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit.

In this project I will demonstrate a Deep Q Learning appraoch to train an agent to solve the provided Banana navigation environment.

This project contains:
* Functional, well-documented, and organized code for training the agent implemented in PyTorch and Python 3
* Saved model weights for my successful agent

## A Note on Unity

The **Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents)** is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods through a simple-to-use Python API.
